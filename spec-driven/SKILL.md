description: "Structured planning pipeline with 4 adaptive phases (Specify, Design, Tasks, Execute) and persistent knowledge accumulation for development teams. Auto-sizes depth by complexity from quick fixes to multi-component features. Use when planning features, specifying requirements, breaking work into tasks, or when user says 'plan this feature', 'specify X', 'help me structure this', 'how should we implement X', 'break this into tasks', 'vamos especificar', 'preciso planejar', 'implementar X', 'cria as tasks', 'quebra em tarefas', 'como vamos fazer X', 'me ajuda a planejar', 'initialize project', 'map codebase', 'quick fix', 'pause work', 'resume work'. Covers requirement traceability, atomic task creation with verification criteria, and session memory via docs/ knowledge base. Do NOT use for architecture decomposition analysis (use architecture skills), technical design docs (use technical-design-doc-creator), or general code review."

# spec-driven

A 6-phase planning and execution pipeline for structured software development. Invoke with `/spec <description>` to begin.

```
LOAD → SPECIFY → DESIGN → TASKS → EXECUTE → LEARN
```

The agent runs all phases inline. Each planning phase ends with a user approval gate before proceeding.

---

## Quick Reference

| Trigger | Scope | Phases |
|---------|-------|--------|
| `/spec quick <desc>` | Quick | LOAD → SPECIFY → EXECUTE → LEARN |
| `/spec medium <desc>` | Medium | LOAD → SPECIFY → TASKS → EXECUTE → LEARN |
| `/spec large <desc>` | Large | LOAD → SPECIFY → DESIGN → TASKS → EXECUTE → LEARN |
| `/spec <desc>` | Auto-detect | All phases, skip based on scope |
| `/spec resume` | Resume | Load last session, continue from checkpoint |
| `/spec pause` | Pause | Save checkpoint to docs/sessions/ |
| `plan this feature` | Auto-detect | Same as `/spec` |
| `initialize project` | Setup | LOAD → scaffold docs/ if missing |
| `map codebase` | LOAD only | Run LOAD, produce context summary |

---

## Scope × Artifacts

| Scope | Artifacts | Output path |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Quick | `TASK.md` | `.specs/quick/NNN-slug/` |
| Medium | `spec.md` + `tasks.md` | `.specs/features/<name>/` |
| Large | `spec.md` + `design.md` + `tasks.md` | `.specs/features/<name>/` |

---

## Phase 1: LOAD

**When**: Always — every invocation starts here.

**Goal**: Build a context summary from prior knowledge before any planning begins.

### Steps

1. Check whether `docs/` exists at the project root.
   - If it does not exist → note "first run" and proceed without prior context. `docs/` will be scaffolded in LEARN phase.

2. If `docs/` exists, read:
   - `docs/project.md` — project overview, modules, active features
   - `docs/conventions.md` — coding patterns, naming rules, structural decisions
   - `docs/decisions.md` — architectural choices made in past sessions
   - The 3 most recent files in `docs/sessions/` (sorted by filename date, descending)

3. If `.specs/codebase/` exists, read relevant files for the feature domain (STACK.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, CONVENTIONS.md). Load on-demand, not eagerly.

4. **Context budget**: Total loaded content must remain under 40k tokens. If docs/ files are large, load the most recent sections or a summary.

5. Produce a **Context Summary** block:

```
## Context Summary

Project: [inferred from docs/project.md or "unknown"]
Active feature: [if resuming]
Known conventions: [bullet list from docs/conventions.md, max 5]
Recent decisions: [bullet list from docs/decisions.md, max 3]
Last session: [date and feature from most recent session log, or "none"]
Prior context loaded from: [list of files read]
```

6. If the user said `map codebase` → stop here and present the Context Summary. Do not proceed to SPECIFY.

---

## Phase 2: SPECIFY

**When**: After LOAD, unless user said `map codebase`.

**Goal**: Capture what to build with testable, traceable requirements.

### 2a. Scope Detection

Use the scoring matrix in `references/scope-detection.md` to determine scope.

1. Analyze the user's description against the 5 signals (files, concepts, ambiguity, integrations, risk).
2. Calculate total score.
3. Present score and reasoning to the user.
4. Ask for confirmation or override.

If the user specified scope explicitly (`/spec quick`, `/spec medium`, `/spec large`) → skip detection, use the specified scope.

### 2b. Clarification

If the request is ambiguous (score ≥ 1 on the Ambiguity signal), ask clarifying questions before writing artifacts. Keep to 1–3 focused questions.

### 2c. Produce Artifact

**Quick scope** → create `.specs/quick/NNN-slug/TASK.md`:
- Check existing `.specs/quick/` entries to determine the next `NNN` number (pad to 3 digits)
- Use template from `references/task-template.md`
- Fill: problem, solution, files, acceptance criteria (WHEN/THEN format), verification

**Medium or Large scope** → create `.specs/features/<name>/spec.md`:
- Use template from `references/spec-template.md`
- Fill: problem statement, goals, out of scope, user stories (P1/P2/P3), acceptance criteria, traceability table, success criteria
- Assign requirement IDs: `[FEAT]-01`, `[FEAT]-02`, etc. where `FEAT` is a 2–4 letter abbreviation of the feature name

### 2d. Approval Gate

Present the artifact to the user. Ask:
> "Does this spec look correct? (approve / adjust)"

Do not proceed until the user approves.

**Idempotency**: If `.specs/features/<name>/spec.md` already exists with `status: approved` → skip this phase and proceed to DESIGN or TASKS.

---

## Phase 3: DESIGN

**When**: Only for Large scope. Skip for Quick and Medium.

**Goal**: Define the technical approach — architecture, components, data models, decisions.

### Steps

1. Check existing codebase for reusable components before designing new ones.
   - Use glob/read to find relevant existing files based on the feature domain.
   - If `codenavi` skill is available, use it for deeper codebase navigation.

2. Apply the **Knowledge Verification Chain**:
   - First: check existing codebase (`src/`, `lib/`, `packages/`)
   - Second: check project docs (`docs/`, `.specs/codebase/`)
   - Third: check `context7` if available (external library docs)
   - Fourth: general knowledge
   - Flag anything uncertain for user review

3. Produce `.specs/features/<name>/design.md`:
   - Use template from `references/design-template.md`
   - Fill: architecture overview, code reuse analysis, components, data models, error handling, tech decisions
   - If `mermaid-studio` skill is available, suggest creating a diagram for the architecture overview

4. **Approval Gate**: Present design to user. Ask:
   > "Does this design look correct? (approve / adjust)"
   Do not proceed until approved.

**Idempotency**: If `design.md` already exists with `status: approved` → skip and proceed to TASKS.

---

## Phase 4: TASKS

**When**: Medium and Large scope only. Skip for Quick (tasks are inline in TASK.md).

**Goal**: Break the spec into atomic, verifiable, sequentially ordered tasks.

### Steps

1. Read `spec.md` and identify all requirement IDs.

2. Produce `.specs/features/<name>/tasks.md`:
   - Use template from `references/tasks-template.md`
   - Each task must have: title, What, Where (file path), Depends on, Requirement ID, Done when (checkboxes)
   - Tasks are ordered by dependency (prerequisites first)
   - Group tasks into logical phases (Setup, Core, Integration, Verification)

3. **Granularity rule**: Each task should be completable in under 30 minutes. If a task would take longer, split it into subtasks.

4. **Traceability**: Every requirement ID in spec.md must appear in at least one task. Add a Requirement Coverage table at the bottom.

5. **Approval Gate**: Present tasks.md to the user. Ask:
   > "Does this task breakdown look correct? (approve / adjust)"
   Do not proceed until approved.

**Idempotency**: If `tasks.md` already exists → check for unchecked tasks. If unchecked tasks remain, proceed to EXECUTE from the first unchecked task. If all checked, proceed to LEARN.

---

## Phase 5: EXECUTE

**When**: After all planning phases are approved.

**Goal**: Implement each task directly, inline, one at a time.

### Steps

For each task in `tasks.md` (or `TASK.md` for Quick scope), in document order:

1. Read the task definition: What, Where, Done when criteria.
2. Load the referenced file(s).
3. Implement the change by editing the file directly.
4. Verify: check each acceptance criterion in "Done when".
   - Run any specified verification command.
   - If a criterion fails → fix it before moving to the next task.
5. Mark the task checkbox `[x]` in the tasks file.
6. Report to the user: "✓ Task N complete: [brief summary]"
7. Proceed to the next task.

### Blockers

If a task cannot be completed due to a dependency on something external (e.g., missing API key, unresolved question):
1. Mark the task `[BLOCKED: reason]` in tasks.md.
2. Report the blocker clearly to the user.
3. Skip dependent tasks (tasks that list the blocked task in "Depends on").
4. Continue with any non-dependent tasks.
5. Do not mark EXECUTE complete until all non-blocked tasks are done.

### Completion

When all tasks are checked (or blocked with explanation):
- Update the `status` frontmatter in tasks.md to `completed` (or `partial` if blocked tasks exist).
- Report summary to the user: total tasks, completed, blocked.
- Proceed to LEARN.

---

## Phase 6: LEARN

**When**: After EXECUTE completes (or on explicit `/spec pause`).

**Goal**: Capture session knowledge and update the persistent docs/ knowledge base.

### 6a. Session Log (Always)

Create `docs/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature>.md` using `references/session-template.md`.

Fill:
- **What Was Done**: bullet list of completed changes
- **Files Changed**: list of files modified or created
- **Decisions Made**: any architectural or design choices made during execution
- **Conventions Discovered**: new patterns or naming rules found in the codebase
- **Open Items**: any blocked tasks or deferred work

Session logs are **immutable**. Once written, never edit them. If the same feature continues in a later session, create a new session log with an incremented date or suffix.

### 6b. Live Docs (Conditional)

Update the following files only when genuinely new information was discovered:

| Discovery | Target | Action |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| New module, feature, or integration | `docs/project.md` | Append new section |
| New code pattern, naming rule, file structure | `docs/conventions.md` | Append new entry |
| Architectural decision with rationale | `docs/decisions.md` | Append ADR-style entry |
| Nothing new | (none) | Skip silently |

**Rules**:
- Append only — never remove or overwrite existing content
- Deduplicate — check existing content before adding; skip if already present
- Attribute — each addition references the source feature: "(from: feature-name, date: YYYY-MM-DD)"

### 6c. First-Run Scaffold

If `docs/` does not exist (first LEARN invocation):

Create the following structure:

```
docs/
├── project.md
├── conventions.md
├── decisions.md
└── sessions/
```

Initial content for each file (see `references/knowledge-base.md` for full scaffold).

### 6d. Graphify (Optional)

If the `graphify` skill is available, suggest:
> "Run `/graphify --update docs/` to update the knowledge graph with new session context."
Do not auto-invoke — leave it as a user action.

### 6e. Completion

Present the LEARN summary to the user:
```
## LEARN Complete

Session log: docs/sessions/{{date}}-{{feature}}.md
Updated: [list of files updated, or "none"]
Graphify: [available / not available]
```

---

## Resume / Pause

### Resume

When the user says `resume work` or `/spec resume`:

1. Run LOAD phase.
2. Check `.specs/features/*/tasks.md` for files with `status: pending` or `status: in-progress`.
3. If found → present the feature name and first unchecked task. Ask: "Resume from here? (yes / no)"
4. If approved → jump to EXECUTE at the first unchecked task.

### Pause

When the user says `pause work` or `/spec pause`:

1. Run LEARN phase (write session log, update live docs).
2. Update `tasks.md` `status` frontmatter to `in-progress`.
3. Report: "Work paused. Resume with `/spec resume`."

---

## Context Loading Strategy

| Content | When to load | Token budget |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| `docs/project.md` | Every invocation | ~2k tokens max |
| `docs/conventions.md` | Every invocation | ~2k tokens max |
| `docs/decisions.md` | Every invocation | ~2k tokens max |
| 3 most recent `docs/sessions/*.md` | Every invocation | ~6k tokens max |
| `.specs/codebase/*.md` | On-demand | ~5k tokens per file |
| Feature spec/design/tasks | When resuming | ~4k tokens max |
| **Total budget** | | **< 40k tokens** |

If any file exceeds its token budget, load the most recent sections only.

---

## Skill Integrations

These integrations are optional. Check if the skill is available before suggesting it.

| Skill | When to suggest |
|-------|----------------|
| `mermaid-studio` | During DESIGN phase, when an architecture diagram would clarify the approach |
| `codenavi` | During DESIGN phase, when deep codebase navigation is needed to find existing components |
| `graphify` | After LEARN phase, to update the knowledge graph |

To check if a skill is available: look for it in the loaded skills list or attempt to invoke it and handle gracefully if not found.
